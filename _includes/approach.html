  <h1>Our Approach</h1>
  <p>AWe focus on reducing pain, enhancing tissue function, and improving movement range through assessments that offer valuable insights. Our approach is multidimensional, considering the whole individual and their unique presentations. We use orthopedic testing to guide manual therapy effectiveness, tailoring treatment plans for personalized care. Adopting a person-centred model of care, we consider the interconnected interactions between physiology, thoughts, emotions, behaviours, cultures, and beliefs when applying a manual therapy plan. Our approach ensures a comprehensive and effective path to pain management and overall health.
