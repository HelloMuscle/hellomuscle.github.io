  <h1>Our Approach</h1>
  <p>Assessment lies at the heart of our treatment philosophy, focusing on common goals such as pain reduction, improved tissue function, and enhanced movement range. While Registered Massage Therapists (RMTs) don't provide diagnoses, our assessments offer valuable insights, yielding outcomes like complete resolution, partial functional improvement, or ongoing maintenance.</p>
  <p>Assessment process serves as a dynamic measurement framework, tracking progress throughout the treatment plan. It not only helps rule out urgent and non-urgent care needs but also identifies factors beyond our scope, prompting timely referrals. Whether addressing acute strains from high-impact sports or chronic conditions linked to repetitive movements, altered breathing patterns or anthalgic adaptations, our multidimensional approach considers the whole individual and their variable presentations.</p>
  <p>In addition to our biosocial assessment framework, orthopaedic testing offers insights into acute injuries, interpreting findings within the patient's context. This ongoing, collaborative approach guides therapists and patients alike, enhancing our understanding of symptoms and optimizing manual therapy effectiveness. By assessing the appropriateness of techniques in location, frequency, duration, and intensity, we tailor treatment plans for personalized care, fostering a meaningful and effective therapeutic journey.</p>
  <p>Contemporary best practices for pain support a multidimensional approach that addresses biosocial influences and empowers patients through shared decision-making. Adopting a person-centred model of care does not discount the use of traditional orthopaedic assessments. Instead, it helps to put into context the interconnected and multidirectional interactions between physiology, thoughts, emotions, behaviours, cultures, and beliefs. This holistic perspective enriches our understanding of each patient's unique experience, allowing us to tailor manual therapy treatment plans that directly address the physical aspects of their ailment while considering the broader influences of well-being. Embracing modern insights and traditional assessments, our approach ensures a comprehensive and effective path to pain management and overall health.</p>
